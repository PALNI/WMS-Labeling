This application is powered by PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. It is entirely self-contained in one folder and can be installed on an existing web server or a new one.\r\n\r\nSome core functionality provided in the 'quicklabels.php' file was provided by David Cunningham, University of New Brunswick Libraries\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](img/example1.png)\r\n\r\n##Request a WSKey\r\n\r\nThis web application uses a WSKey from OCLC in order to authenticate your connection. Read about how to [request a WSKey here][1].\r\n\r\nOn the \"Request a WSKey\" page, here are the settings you need to utilize this application:\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Environment:** Production\r\n* **Services:** Check \"WMS Collection Management API\" and \"WorldCat Search API\"\r\n* **What is the reason for this request?** To use the University of New Mexico's custom labeling application\r\n* **Redirect URI:** Leave blank\r\n* **Usage:** Check \"I am an OCLC Partner accessing data on behalf of libraries\"\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\nClone this repository into your web directory (\"git clone {url} labeling\") or download directly from GitHub.  Install [TCPDF][2] inside /labeling (e.g., if WMS-Labeling is at /www/labeling then tcpdf should be at /www/labeling/tcpdf).\r\n\r\nCopy config/config.php.template to config/config.php. Open config/config.php and add your [OCLC WSKey][3] credentials. Set your ```base_url``` to match your folder or leave blank if your site will be the root folder.\r\n\r\nCopy config/crosswalks.php.example to config/crosswalks.php. Open config/crosswalks.php to map shelving locations to desired call number prefixes (e.g., Reference should print as REF on your label).\r\n\r\nCopy scripts/laser.config.sample.php to any scripts/{name}.config.php (Default: laser.config.php). Edit desired margins/spacing and settings for your label printer stock. **Note:** If you add label style\r\nfiles aside from \"laser.config.php\", you will need to add extra radio inputs in inc/fetch_labels.php. Search for ```<div class=\"print-area\">``` and add to the inputs below it.\r\n\r\n##Setup\r\n\r\n###config.php\r\n\r\nAfter you get your WSKey, you'll need to go back to [WSKey Management][4], browse to \"WsKey\" on the left sidebar, and click on your listed WSKey to display all your information. This page will contain all the information you need for config.php.\r\n\r\n###crosswalks.php\r\n\r\nThe crosswalks array is utilized in order to take various codes/wording from WMS and translate them to building locations and other specifics.\r\n\r\n###laser.config.php\r\n\r\nEdit this file to create the layout of your label stock. We used a ruler with millimeters to measure the layout of our label sheets. This config file will most likely need many test prints and tweaks before you get it right.\r\n\r\n##Printing\r\n###Print/edit a single label\r\n\r\nLaunch yoursite.com/labeling and scan in a barcode and indicate whether a pocket label is desired. Click the \"Make Labels\" button.\r\n\r\nIn the preview screen, click anywhere on the call number to edit it if needed. Make your changes and click OK.\r\n\r\n![Editing](img/example2.png)\r\n\r\nSelect \"Laser Printer\" or any other config that you've added. Click \"Print Labels\". A PDF will be generated. Press Ctrl + P to send the PDF to your printer.\r\n\r\n###Print labels in a batch\r\n\r\nAfter scanning a barcode, hit Enter on your keyboard, or press \"Add More\" button at the bottom of the screen to add multiple barcodes. The maximum labels per page is set in the config/{name}.config.php file.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/authentication/how-to-request-a-wskey.en.html\r\n[2]: http://www.tcpdf.org/installation.php  \r\n[3]: http://oclc.org/developer/develop/authentication/how-to-request-a-wskey.en.html\r\n[4]: https://platform.worldcat.org/wskey/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
